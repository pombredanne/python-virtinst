=head1 NAME

virt-image - create virtual machines from an image descriptor

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<virt-image> [OPTION]... IMAGE.XML

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<virt-image> is a command line tool for creating virtual machines from an
XML image descriptor C<IMAGE.XML> (L<virt-image(5)>). Most attributes of
the virtual machine are taken from the XML descriptor (e.g., where the
files to back the virtual machine's disks are and how to map them into the
guest), though certain information must be added on the command line, such
as the name of the guest.

The XML descriptor defines most attributes of the guest, making it possible
to bundle and distribute it together with the files backing the guest's
disks.

=head1 OPTIONS

Most options can be omitted, in which case B<virt-image> will use defaults
from the XML descriptor. When defaults are taken from the XML descriptor,
they are indicated below as a path. --name is the only required command
line option.

=over 4

=item -h, --help

Show the help message and exit

=item --connect=CONNECT

Connect to a non-default hypervisor. See L<virt-install(1)> for details

=back

=head2 General Options

General configuration parameters that apply to all types of guest installs.

=over 2

=item  -n NAME, --name=NAME

Name of the guest instance

=item -r MEMORY, --ram=MEMORY

Memory to allocate for guest instance in megabytes. Defaults to
C</image/devices/memory> in the XML descriptor.

=item  -u UUID, --uuid=UUID

UUID for the guest; if none is given a random UUID will be generated. If
you specify UUID, you should use a 32-digit hexadecimal number.

=item --vcpus=VCPUS

Number of vcpus to configure for your guest. Defaults to
C</image/devices/vcpu> in the XML descriptor.

=item  --check-cpu

Check that vcpus do not exceed physical CPUs and warn if they do.

=item  --os-type=OS_TYPE

Optimize the guest configuration for a type of operating system (ex. 'linux',
'windows'). This will attempt to pick the most suitable ACPI & APIC settings,
optimally supported mouse drivers, virtio, and generally accommodate other
operating system quirks.  See L<virt-install(1)> for valid values.

=item --os-variant=OS_VARIANT

Further optimize the guest configuration for a specific operating system
variant (ex. 'fedora8', 'winxp'). This parameter is optional, and does not
require an C<--os-type> to be specified. See L<virt-install(1)> for valid
values.

=back

=head2 Full Virtualization specific options

Parameters specific only to fully virtualized guest installs.

=over 2

=item --noapic

Disables APIC for fully virtualized guest (overrides value in XML descriptor)

=item --noacpi

Disables ACPI for fully virtualized guest (overrides value in XML descriptor)

=back

=head2 Networking Configuration

=over 2

=item -m MAC, --mac=MAC

This is deprecated in favor of C<--network ...,mac=MAC,...>

=item -b BRIDGE, --bridge=BRIDGE

This is deprecated in favor of C<--network bridge=BRIDGE>

=item -w NETWORK, --network=NETWORK

Connect the guest to the host network. See L<virt-install(1)> for details

=back

=head2 Graphics Configuration

If no graphics option is specified, C<virt-install> will default to --vnc
if the DISPLAY environment variable is set, otherwise --nographics is used.

=over 2

=item --vnc

Setup a virtual console in the guest and export it as a VNC server in
the host. See L<virt-install(1)> for details

=item --vncport=VNCPORT

Request a permanent, statically assigned port number for the guest VNC
console. See L<virt-install(1)> for details

=item --vnclisten=VNCLISTEN

Address to listen on for VNC connections. See L<virt-install(1)> for details.

=item -k KEYMAP, --keymap=KEYMAP

Request that the virtual VNC console be configured to run with a non-English
keyboard layout.

=item --sdl

Setup a virtual console in the guest and display an SDL window in the
host to render the output. See L<virt-install(1)> for details

=item --nographics

Do not attach a graphical device to the guest. See
L<virt-install(1)> for details

=back

=head2 Miscellaneous Options

=over 2

=item -p, --print

Print the libvirt XML, but do not start the guest.

=item --boot=BOOT

The zero-based index of the boot record to use. The XML descriptor can
contain multiple C</image/domain/boot> elements for use on different
hypervisors. By default, the one that is most appropriate for the current
hypervisor is selected.

=item --replace

Shutdown and remove any existing guest with the passed C<--name> before
installing from the image.

=item --skip-checksum

Do not check disk images against checksums (if they are listed in the
image xml).

=item -d, --debug

Print debugging information

=item --force

Prevent interactive prompts. If the intended prompt was a yes/no prompt, always
say yes. For any other prompts, the application will exit.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

Create and start a guest called C<example> with a VNC console from
C<image.xml>:

  # virt-image --name example --vnc -i image.xml

Print the libvirt XML for a guest called C<example> without graphics, but
do not create or start a virtual machine:

  # virt-image --print --name example --nographics --image image.xml
